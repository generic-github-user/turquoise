# Turquoise

## Features

- [Infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) for a variety of [mathematical operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathematical_operators)
- Shorthand functions for common operations and expressions
- Seamless integration of calculations involving numbers, symbols, strings, booleans, lists, and more

Several tools for debugging and development are also under development or planned:

- [Transpiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpiling) to clean [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python) code
- Interactive visualization of the [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abstract_syntax_tree) for use in debugging
- A [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linter) to standardize code written in Turquoise
- A [profiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/profiler) to analyze the performance of Turquoise programs
- [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) and [space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_complexity) analysis of algorithms
- An interactive debugger

## Design Philosophy

### Brevity
Turquoise draws on the [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object-oriented) principles of languages like [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), but emphasizes concision to accelerate the development workflow.

### Flexibility
Turquoise's data structures and operators are structured to be infinitely reconfigurable to the needs of your task.

### Efficiency
A core part of Turquoise's design philosophy revolves around making the planning -> development -> feedback loop as seamless and pain-free as possible. The language is dynamic and meant to be interacted with as a key part of the development process.

### Interoperability
This is currently a (very) new and feature-limited programming language, so it is intended to work cohesively with other technologies, libraries, and modules while maintaining a reasonable dependency scope for the language's core features. Eventually, Turquoise will be able to run arbitrary [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python) code on representations of its data structures and likewise, snippets of Turquoise code will be able to be executed with a Python library. [Transpiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpiling) (transcompiling) is also being explored as a way to bridge the gap between Turquoise's methodology and Python's massive ecosystem of modules and libraries.

### Intuitiveness
Everything in the language should, to a reasonable extent, do what you expect it to. When confusion arises, efficient strategies for clarifying the language's behavior will be available.

### Consistency
Exceptions to rules and principles should be minimized wherever possible in order to make the language's basic concepts universally applicable.

## Contributing

Turquoise is not accepting contributions at this time. If there is a feature you want considered for the language, please feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/generic-github-user/turquoise/issues/new/choose). Contributions of pull requests and specific functionality may be accepted in the future once the core features of the language have been built out and it is reasonably stable.
